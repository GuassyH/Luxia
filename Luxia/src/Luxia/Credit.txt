Thank you to TheCherno, whose first few episodes on Game Engine Development with C++ inspired me to start this project.
I did make use of TheCherno's Logging system (one of the first episodes) as well as his premake tutorial to set up the build system.
I also referred to his information on structure the folder hierarchy, as my last project had a very flat structure which made it hard to navigate.
So thank you TheCherno for your educational content! You are a great inspiration to many, including me.

Thank you to all the open source contributors whose libraries and assets I have used in this project. Your work is greatly appreciated!

If there is any content in this project that you believe requires credit and is not mentioned here, please reach out to me so I can update this file accordingly.

Special Thanks to CarBrix, for adding the logo of Luxia to his game.
