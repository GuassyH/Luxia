IMPORTANT

--- IDEAS ---

- Rendering on a seperate thread? Performance boost ash

- Importing should also be given path to import TO. so you can import from an external folder (maybe?)

- First half extent valid, when stopping starting again its reset to 0.5

- Collider class holds the collider type and the ShapeRefC. When creating collider it will take the type into account
	That way you can call "HasComponent<Collider>()" and it will return true if it has any collider, not just a specific one. Also when adding a collider component it will check if there is already a collider component and if there is it will replace it instead of adding a new one. That way you can change the collider type without having to remove the old one first

THIS
- Maybe adding component should push an event? Could slow the engine down a LOT however could be good for for example when a mesh is added or a light

- When renaming folder, send folder new name to assetmanager map, when saving assetmanager or reimporting
	then check if the metafile or assetfile path is in the assetmanager path map and replace it with new path

--- Issues ---

- When starting and stopping scene through editor memory usage goes up and stays up. Something isnt being cleared when scene is changed

---  Next  ---

- Rework how scene lifetime works.

- Rework enabling, made it so its the components that are enabled and not. The entity being enabled is the transform being enabled

- Cleanup

--- Future ---

- I want to switch to static library for a lot of the vendor products

- Shadows

- Maybe Deffered rendering?

--- For adding renderers ---

- Add definitions in Core (for input, vars, etc)

- Create the classes (VK_Camera, VK_Texture)

- Add Platform creation definitions 

- Keep in mind editor is not NEARLY abstracted enough
