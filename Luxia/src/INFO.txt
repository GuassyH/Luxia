IMPORTANT

- YAML
	For some reason you NEED to use the debug build in debug mode and the release build in release.
	No clue why, but i want to fix in the future, for now im just going to focus on advancing

- Initializing OpenGL should happen in the openGL renderer, NOT the Window

- SetParent 
	Setting Parent should calculate the new size, and de-setting should also, so that you dont mess up the size

- Scene Index (right now their order is based on when they are loaded)

- Resources (like built in shaders and meshes that come with the engine) should be loaded once, and not per scene, and shared across projects)

- Renaming entities and assetfiles in the editor

- Inefficient AssetFile and MetaFile relationship, maybe they should have the same GUID? That would make lookups faster
