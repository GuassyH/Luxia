IMPORTANT

- Rendering on a seperate thread? Performance boost ash

- Rework enabling, made it so its the components that are enabled and not. The entity being enabled is the transform being enabled

- Importing should also be given path to import TO. so you can import from an external folder (maybe?)

- Maybe adding component should push an event? Could slow the engine down a LOT however could be good for for example when a mesh is added or a light

---  Next  ---

- Scene renaming is weird, it wont rename the scene for some reason

- Cleanup

--- Future ---

- Shadows

- Maybe Deffered rendering?

--- For adding renderers ---

- Add definitions in Core (for input, vars, etc)

- Create the classes (VK_Camera, VK_Texture)

- Add Platform creation definitions 

- Keep in mind editor is not NEARLY abstracted enough
