YAML
	For some reason you NEED to use the debug build in debug mode and the release build in release.

Initializing OpenGL should happen in the openGL renderer, NOT the Window

SetParent 
	Setting Parent should calculate the new size, and de-setting should also, so that you dont mess up the size

Menus For the editor (addcomponent)

Scene Index (right now their order is based on when they are loaded)

Maybe change PlatformDefinitions to Macros. 
	LX_CREATE_SHADER(__VA_ARGS__) instead of Platform::Assets::CreateShader();
	Less code to compile / include / write
