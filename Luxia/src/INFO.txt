IMPORTANT

YAML
	For some reason you NEED to use the debug build in debug mode and the release build in release.
	No clue why, but i want to fix in the future, for now im just going to focus on advancing

Model Loading
	Should not create entities, should instead create meshes with materials
	Entities should then be able to reference these, or use ref_model or something

Mesh
	Should be its own asset stored in the luxmodel file, with guid and that. So when entity is loaded
	it can have the meshes GUID if it has a meshrenderer
