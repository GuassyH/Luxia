IMPORTANT

- YAML
	For some reason you NEED to use the debug build in debug mode and the release build in release.
	No clue why, but i want to fix in the future, for now im just going to focus on advancing

- Initializing OpenGL should happen in the openGL renderer, NOT the Window

- SetParent 
	Setting Parent should calculate the new size, and de-setting should also, so that you dont mess up the size

- Add Redstone PFP Sun

- Scene Index (right now their order is based on when they are loaded)

- Rendering on a seperate thread? Performance boost ash

- Maybe MeshRenderer should store the GUIDs of the mesh and mat and not the shared_ptr to it

- Rework enabling, made it so its the components that are enabled and not. The entity being enabled is the transform being enabled

- Importing should also be given path to import TO. so you can import from an external folder (maybe?)

- IMPORTANT, MAKE SURE WHEN EXPORTING BLENDER MODELS FOR GIZMOS, +Z IS FORWARD AND +Y IS UP

---  Next  ---

- Scene renaming is weird, it wont rename the scene for some reason

- Cleanup

--- Future ---

- Lighting (at least global illumination / sun)

- Shadows

- Maybe Deffered rendering?

--- For adding renderers ---

- Add definitions in Core (for input, vars, etc)

- Create the classes (VK_Camera, VK_Texture)

- Add Platform creation definitions
