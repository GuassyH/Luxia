IMPORTANT

- YAML
	For some reason you NEED to use the debug build in debug mode and the release build in release.
	No clue why, but i want to fix in the future, for now im just going to focus on advancing

- Initializing OpenGL should happen in the openGL renderer, NOT the Window

- SetParent 
	Setting Parent should calculate the new size, and de-setting should also, so that you dont mess up the size

- Scene Index (right now their order is based on when they are loaded)

- Resources (like built in shaders and meshes that come with the engine) should be loaded once, and not per scene, and shared across projects)
		- USE CMAKE

- Rendering on a seperate thread? Performance boost ash

- Rework Scene Serializer and SceneFile structure

- Maybe MeshRenderer should store the GUIDs of the mesh and mat and not the shared_ptr to it

---  Next  ---

- Scene renaming is weird, it wont rename the scene for some reason

- When importing it opens the last opened filepath, not the file path you clicked import in

- Importing something imports to the same folder that the asset is in, i want to be able to import an asset from outside the project, and just get the path to it and filestuff

- Cleanup

--- Future ---

- Lighting (at least global illumination / sun)

- Shadows

- Maybe Deffered rendering?

--- For adding renderers ---

- Add definitions in Core (for input, vars, etc)

- Create the classes (VK_Camera, VK_Texture)

- Add Platform creation definitions 

--- Maybe ? ---

- Selection outline is currently depth based, which can look weird. Maybe it should be geometry shader based?
